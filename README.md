An attempt to create a simple chess engine in c++.

## Why?
I am a fan of chess and programming, and this project is a perfect mix between the two. 

## TODO:
- Implement opening book and endgame books
- Create lichess bot
- Add continuous integration
- Increase test coverage
## In progress
- UCI-conformity (http://wbec-ridderkerk.nl/html/UCIProtocol.html)
- Complete evaluation function
- Implement Zobrist hashing and lookups
